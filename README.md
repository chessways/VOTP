# Versatile One Time Pad

Powerful, versatile and hardened. Far superior to any otp app i have ever seen. Ai made it (chatgpt o3-pro) and it will only get better from here. I would warn against changes made by lesser ai models. Lots of care, sessions , re-writes and testing went into this. A lesser model of ai might steer you wrong. Ai improves fast, so wait for it to get way better before you blindly accept code edits. Current ai model costs 200 usd a month, to give you an idea of its strength. 

As is, this has lots of options. It will have about 3x more options in the future. The idea of this app is to be so versatile that it handles any need or function. Made with the highest ai model i have access to- and it took hours of thinking/processing by that model. Literally hours. Re-writes, design theory, and hardening. Ai improves so fast that this app will be outdated.
